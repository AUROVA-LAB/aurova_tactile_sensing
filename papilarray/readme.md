To use the interfaces, it is supposed that you already have the libraries and ROS workspaces to run the PapilArray tactile sensors that provide the Contactile company.

Once you have the catkin workspace that allows us to launch the sensors and get forces from them, you just need to add these two scripts in the script folder. We usually use the online version to display the forces in real-time, and the offline version when we do not have access to the real sensor, and we just want to display data from rosbags.

Here you can see a picture of a grasping example.
