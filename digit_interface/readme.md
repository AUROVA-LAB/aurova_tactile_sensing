In this package, there are two important files: digit.py in scripts folder, and digit.launch in launch folder.

Currently, the digit.py script is prepared to run two DIGIT sensors simultaneously. It is important to indicate the serial number of the DIGIT sensors in the digit.launch file. 

The instructions to use this package are explained in the applications repository (link soon).
